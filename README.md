# Base58 - Swift

This repo contains a simple pure swift implementation of the base58 encoding spec. It is inspired by the [go-base-58](https://github.com/jbenet/go-base58).

This is a personal package and probably should not be used. But if anyone wants to use it you can through Swift PM.

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/m1thrandir225/base58-swift", from: "1.0.0")
```
